# Handbrake-Batch-Convertor
A small app to generate .HBQ files that import into Handbrake

As I do a lot of media encoding, Often I'll have multiple copies of Handbrake open encoding away.  Sometimes I'm working through a list of hundreds of files at once.  This can get quite tiresome going through them one by one to queue them all up.

So along comes this handy app - It'll scan a directory of video files with certain extensions and automatically generate a .HBQ file for you.  It can even generate multiple .HBQ files from the same list, in case you wanted to have multiple Handbrake instances open at once.

There is no malicious code in here but I accept no responsibility for any damages this app may make to your machine.

## To Compile
Using *Visual Studio*, load the solution and click start.  You can publish the app from there too, if you want to generate a setup.exe file.

## Or Download Windows EXE
You can download the app from http://chud37.com/code/HandbrakeBatchConvertor, in ZIP format.
